    <p><i>(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)</i><br><br><br>
       To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
       The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
       or to take arms agains a sea of troubles<br>
       And by opposing end them. To die&mdash;to sleep,<br>
       No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
       The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
       That flesh is heir to:&rsquo;tis a consummation<br>
       Devously to be wish	&rsquo;d. To die, to sleep;<br>
       To sleep, perchance to dream&mdash;ay, there's the rub:<br>
       For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
       When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
       Must give us pause-there's the respect<br>
       Must give us pause&mdash;there's the respect<br>
       That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
       The pangs of dispriz&rsquo;d love, and the spurns<br>
       That patient merit of th&rsquo;unworthy takes,<br>
       When he himself might his quietus make<br>
       With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>
       To grunt and swear under a weary life,<br>
       The undiscovered&rsquo;, from whose bourn<br>
       No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br>
       And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
       Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
       Thus conscience does make cowards of us all<br>
       And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
       Is sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
       And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
       With this regard their currents turn awry<br>
       And lose the name of action.</p>
