    <P><i>(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)</i></P><br><br><br><br>
    <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br></p>
    <p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br></p>
    <P>or to take arms agains a sea of troubles<br></P>
    <p>And by opposing end them. To die&mdash;to sleep,<br></p>
    <p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br></p>
    <p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br></p>
    <p>That flesh is heir to:&rsquo;tis a consummation<br></p>
    <p>Devously to be wish	&rsquo;d. To die, to sleep;<br></p>
    <P>To sleep, perchance to dream&mdash;ay, there's the rub:<br></P>
    <P>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br></P>
    <P>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
    <p>Must give us pause-there's the respect<br></p>
    <p>Must give us pause&mdash;there's the respect<br></p>
    <p>That makes calamity of so long life.<br></p>
    <p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br></p>
    <p>The pangs of dispriz&rsquo;d love, and the spurns<br></p>
    <p>That patient merit of th&rsquo;unworthy takes,<br></p>
    <p>When he himself might his quietus make<br></p>
    <p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br></p>
    <p>To grunt and swear under a weary life,<br></p>
    <p>The undiscovered&rsquo;, from whose bourn<br></p>
    <p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br></p>
    <p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br></p>
    <p>Than fly to others that we know not of?<br></p>
    <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all<br></p>
    <p>And thus the native hue of resolution<br></p>
    <p>Is sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of thought,<br></p>
    <p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br></p>
    <p>With this regard their currents turn awry<br></p>
    <p>And lose the name of action.</p>
